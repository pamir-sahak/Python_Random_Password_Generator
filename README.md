# Python_Random_Password_Generator

I made this python application using PYQT5(QT Designer).

password.py file contains all codes of GUI design.

pass_funcs.py file contains all functions and task of this application.

pass_func.exe file is a working format file of the application for windows.

You may need all the files and icons in the added hierarchy for the application in order to work properly.

Disclaimer: this is just a hobby project for non-commercial use only none of these icons belongs to me I just found them throw the internet.
